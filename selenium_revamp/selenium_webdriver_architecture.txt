Selenium Architecture 
    There are 4 parts in Selenium Architecture:
        1. Client libraries - Each language has Selenium support 
        2. JSON wire protocol(over HTTP): This protocol acts as a communication channel between the client libraries and the webdriver.
        3. Webdriver - this is what drives the browser driver using a json mapping of functions to every browser action 
        example. driver.forward(), driver.back(), driver.refresh() 
        4. Real Browser. The automation actually happens in the browser but this is driven by the webdriver with the help client libraries and the json mapping of the functionalities over HTTP

Why can't we directly interact with the browser?
Most of the driver functions are written generically: for a webdriver class. The changes are later tailored according to each driver. But this wouldn't be possible if it was the direct browser as each browser is different.
