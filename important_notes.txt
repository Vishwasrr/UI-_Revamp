Implicit waits typically have a default polling frequency of 250 milliseconds.
Explicit waits often use shorter intervals in the range of 100-500 milliseconds.
Fluent waits allow flexible configuration based on your specific needs and the expected response time of the element/condition.

Wait examples are illustrated in other demos as and when required

driver = webdriver.Edge()
